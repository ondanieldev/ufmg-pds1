# UFMG - PD1 Activities

## Introduction

This repository contains solutions for ten exercice lists, three tests and one challenge. It was developed to learn about C and basic programming concepts at the university.

## List 01

In the first list there are solutions about extremely basic concepts, such as variables, input, output and memory usage.

## List 02

In the second list there are solutions about basic functions, such as weight calc.

## List 03

In the third list there are solutions about selection structures, such as `if` and `switch case`.

## List 04

In the fourth list there are solutions about recursion, such as factorial and fibonacci algorithms.

## List 05

In the fifth list there are solutions about loop structures, such as `for`, `while` and `do while`.

## List 06

In the sixth list there are solutions about archives, such as read and write on external text files.

## List 07

In the seventh list there are solutions about arrays.

## List 09

In the nineth list there are solutions about matrices.

## List 10

In the tenth list there are solutions about structs (objects).
